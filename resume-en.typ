  == Work Experience

    #cventry(
        tl: [Rust Foundation Fellowship Program],
        tl_comments: redact(alter: "")[ (10 recipients worldwide)],
        tr: [2024.09 - 2025.06 (expected)],
    )[
        - *Contributing to rust-analyzer* (the official Rust IDE)
          - Ranked *19/970* in contributors; resolved *over 50 issues* and contributing to multiple modules (e.g. *semantic analysis*, etc.), improving robustness of the project. Also introduced several new features (e.g. *control flow navigation*, etc.);
          - Implemented a *SIMD* version of the line-breaking algorithm, leading to a *6.5x* speedup for this module on ARM;
          - *Resolved a P0 incident in v0.3.1992*. 4 hours after the release, the community encountered a critical bug that drained resources and blocked processes. I identified the issue *in 3 hours* and designed a new algorithm as fix. This emergency fix mitigated the incident, preventing widespread disruptions for Rust users and improving project stability.
        - *Open-source community maintenance*: Including meeting discussions, bug fixes, PR reviews, and more.

  == Awards

  - 2022 *National Scholarship* (Ranked 1/195 in the major), *Outstanding Graduate* of Beihang University
  - *1st Prize* in the #link("https://compiler.educg.net")[NSCSCC Compilation System Design Competition] (Huawei Bisheng Cup) 2021, ranking 2nd overall.
  - Additionally awarded over ten provincial and university-level awards and scholarships

      tl: [Vizsla],
      tl_comments: [, a modern Verilog/SV IDE for hardware development (Rust / SystemVerilog)],
      tr: [(In development)],
  )[
      - (*Project Leader*) Designed the core architecture of the IDE, the incremental computation processes, intermediate representation, semantic analysis module, etc. Also implemented most of the IDE functionalities.
      - Aimed to equip chip design with modern IDE features (e.g. *code navigaiton*, *completion*, etc.) to enhance productivity.
      - Based on the LSP, built an *incremental semantic analysis framework*#redact(alter: "")[, achieving world-class performance and usability].
